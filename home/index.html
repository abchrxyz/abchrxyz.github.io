        <h3>
          Computer Science Major at Drexel University
          <br />
          Concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering
        </h3>
        <p id="text-content">
          As a Computer Science major specializing in artificial intelligence
          and software engineering, I am driven by a passion for building
          intelligent, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. I enjoy
          solving problems, optimizing solutions, and creating practical
          software that can be used in a real-world context. Due to my work
          experience as a member of a team, I thrive in collaborative and
          commmunicative environments, where innovative thinking and continuous
          learning are valued.
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe that technology should empower people and solve meaningful
          challenges with clarity and integrity. Building intelligent software
          is not just about writing code. It requires empathy for users,
          collaboration across diverse teams, and a commitment to continuous
          improvement. By focusing on scalable, maintainable solutions and
          embracing innovation, I strive to contribute to projects that make a
          positive impact in both the tech community and the broader world.

          When I'm not programming or doing work for class, I enjoy playing
          video games with my friends, rock climbing, reading manga and
          webnovels, and listening to music. I am always very passionate about
          the activities that I enjoy.
          <br />
          <br />
          I started rock climbing in the summer before college, and have been
          on-and-off due to a couple of semi-serious injuries that I've gotten
          in my fingers. However, I have always stayed connected with the sport
          by working at Drexel's Rock Climbing Wall, and work both as a Manager
          while the rock wall is open for business, and as a "setter", which
          means that I create the routes that people climb. The main thing that
          I love about rock climbing is the problem solving, which is also why I
          love programming so much.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've been playing games almost my whole entire life, and have always
          been very competitive and passionate. My childhood dream was to become
          a pro gamer, and while that was never achieved, I am quite proud of my
          achievements. In high school, I achieved the rank of the Top 400
          players on Overwatch's North America East servers, and won a couple of
          tournaments with my high school's eSports team. While I don't play as
          seriously anymore and mainly use gaming as a way to spend time with
          friends, my passion and drive to succeed has carried over to
          programming.
